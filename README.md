# ExGen

Code in working progress for 2 X 2 design. Design is Age x Task

Code is still in development and may have bugs. Data will be uploaded shortly. At the moment I am focussing on uploading code for figures

<h3> Experimental Design</h3>

ERP experiment involving two groups: N=24 Younger (18-25yrs) and N=24 Older (60+yrs) participants. Participants completed two tasks counterbalanced between participants. In the GENDER tasks participants completed a 2AFC Male versus Female categorisation of faces. In the EXNEX task participants completed a 2AFC Expressive ('Happy') versus non-Expressive ('neutral') categorisation of faces. 

<b> Current Code exists for illustrating group level behavioural permutations. </b>
